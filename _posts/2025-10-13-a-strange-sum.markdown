Here's an interesting one -<br>An infinite series with infinitely many infinite regressions...<br>Are there values of omega (in red) for which this series is actually defined?<br>Are there values of omega for which this series actually converges?<br>Can these questions even can be answered?<br>I'll give you a hint - the answer to the last one is "yes"   ;-)

$$\LARGE \sum^{\infty}_{a=0} \frac{\color{red}\Omega}{(\color{red}\Omega\color{black}+a)\left(\color{red}\Omega\color{black}+a\sum^{\infty}_{b=0} \frac{\color{red}\Omega\color{black}}{(\color{red}\Omega\color{black}+b)\left(\color{red}\Omega\color{black}+b+\sum^{\infty}_{c=0} \frac{\color{red}\Omega\color{black}}{(\color{red}\Omega\color{black}+c)(\color{red}\Omega\color{black}+c+...)}\right)}\right)}$$


In the next post, I will derive a solution to this puzzle using (mostly) elementary mathematics.

Stay tuned!
